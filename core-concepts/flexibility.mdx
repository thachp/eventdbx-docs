title: "Flexibility"
description: "Adapt EventDBX to each bounded context without rewriting aggregates."
---

Explain how flexibility emerges from domain isolation, schema modes, and plugin selection.

## Topics to cover

- Show how `dbx checkout` creates per-domain state so experiments stay isolated.
- Explain evolving aggregate shapes safely by re-snapshotting and replaying events.
- Document how plugin payload slices let read models diverge without touching the write path.
