EventDBX bakes auditability into the storage model. Every event carries human-readable metadata, snapshots supply quick checkpoints, and Merkle proofs give you cryptographic evidence when regulators ask “how do you know?”.

## Build complete timelines

Use metadata to capture actor, channel, and reason for each event:

```bash
dbx aggregate apply person p-110 person_address_changed \
  --payload '{"city":"New York","country":"US"}' \
  --metadata '{
    "@actor":"csr-22",
    "@ticket":"INC-4922",
    "@source":"support-portal"
  }'
```

Later, export the full history:

```bash
dbx aggregate events person p-110 --format table
```

Include snapshots when sharing with audit teams so they can see derived state without replaying the entire list.

## Generate proofs

`dbx aggregate proof` emits the Merkle path needed to verify an event or snapshot:

```bash
dbx aggregate proof person p-110 --event 32 > proof.json
```

Auditors can combine `proof.json` with the aggregate’s root hash (stored in the snapshot) to verify integrity independently. Sign the proof using your organization’s key to make tampering obvious.

## Tamper-evident exports

When exporting data for regulators or partners:

1. Generate a snapshot tarball with `dbx backup --aggregates person`.
2. Sign the archive using `gpg --detach-sign`.
3. Provide the signature + Merkle root in the transfer manifest.

Anyone can verify the signature plus the Merkle proof to ensure nothing changed in transit.

## Operational playbook

- **Incident review**: pull the relevant aggregates, replay commands, and attach proofs to the RCA.
- **Access review**: compare audit log entries with aggregate histories to confirm only authorized tokens touched sensitive data.
- **Policy enforcement**: trigger alerts when events arrive without required metadata (e.g., missing `@actor`), or when proof verification fails.

Because EventDBX never mutates prior events, you always have the source data needed to answer “what happened, when, and who did it?”.
