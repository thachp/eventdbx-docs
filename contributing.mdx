Thanks for helping improve EventDBX! This guide covers expectations for issues, pull requests, docs, and releases.

## Code of conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Be respectful, assume best intent, and keep reviews focused on the work.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2. Install dependencies (`pnpm install`, `cargo install`, etc. depending on the component you touch).
3. Run the test suite relevant to your change.

Use feature branches named `feature/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>` so maintainers can track work easily.

## Development workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-plugin
pnpm lint
pnpm test
dbx unit --all
```

- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Update or add tests when behavior changes.
- Run `pnpm format` (or the applicable formatter) before opening a PR.

## Documentation

- Update `docs.json` when adding or renaming pages.
- Keep frontmatter (`title`, `description`) meaningful so navigation stays clear.
- When introducing new concepts, link to related guides so readers build context.

If you spot a placeholder page, replace it with full prose/examples—future contributors will thank you.

## Pull requests

- Fill out the PR template, noting any breaking changes.
- Include screenshots or CLI outputs when the change affects UX.
- Mention the issue number (`Fixes #123`) so automation can close it.

Maintainers aim to review within two business days. Feel free to ping politely if you have not heard back.

## Releases

Release managers cut tags weekly. To get into a release:

1. Merge your PR before the code freeze (posted in `#release` channel).
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the “Unreleased” section.
3. Verify CI pipelines are green.

## Communication

- Join `#eventdbx-dev` on Slack for quick questions.
- File issues for bugs or feature requests; include reproduction steps and logs.
- Use Discussions for RFCs or architectural proposals.

We appreciate every fix, doc improvement, or idea—thank you for investing in EventDBX!
