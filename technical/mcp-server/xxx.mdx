The XXX extension explores remote attestation for plugins that process regulated data. It is experimental but lives here so design notes stay close to the MCP documentation.

## Problem statement

Regulated industries often require proof that only approved binaries process sensitive payloads. Today MCP ensures config consistency but does not attest to plugin integrity. XXX aims to close that gap.

## Proposed design

1. Operators upload a signed manifest describing the expected plugin binary hash.
2. MCP issues a nonce; plugins sign it with their embedded TPM or enclave key.
3. MCP verifies the attestation quote against the manifest before handing out secrets.

## Open questions

- Which attestation mechanisms should we support first (TPM, Nitro Enclaves, SGX)?
- How frequently should re-attestation occur without overloading clusters?
- Should MCP revoke secrets automatically when attestation fails, or leave it to operators?

## Next steps

- Prototype TPM-based attestation on Linux agents.
- Design the API surface (`mcp attestation verify`) so CI/CD can upload manifests.
- Document fallback paths for environments without hardware-backed attestation.
