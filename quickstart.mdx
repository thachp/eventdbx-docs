EventDBX ships as a single CLI named `dbx`. Follow the steps below to go from zero to a running daemon with authenticated client access.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install and start the daemon">

```bash
npm install -g eventdbx
dbx start --foreground
```

- Omit `--foreground` to run as a background service.
- Use `--restrict=strict` once your schemas are locked in.
- Logs stream to stdout; press `Ctrl+C` to stop the daemon when running in the foreground.

</Step>

<Step title="Mint a token">

Tokens grant CLI, SDK, and plugin access. Mint one for local development, export it, and keep the JSON for audit purposes.

```bash
dbx token generate --group admin --user admin --action "*.*"
```

- Use `--action "*.*"` for scoped access.
- Revoke tokens with `dbx token revoke <id>` if they leak.
- CI pipelines can mint short-lived tokens with `--ttl 10m`.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect with the JavaScript SDK">

```ts
import { createClient } from "eventdbxjs";

const client = createClient({
  ip: process.env.EVENTDBX_HOST ?? "127.0.0.1",
  port: Number(process.env.EVENTDBX_PORT) || 6363,
  token: process.env.EVENTDBX_TOKEN,
});

await client.connect();

await client.create("person", "p-110", "person_created", {
  payload: {
    fist_name: "Demo",
    last_name: "Demo",
    email: "jane@example.com",
  },
  metadata: { "@createdBy": "<current-id>" },
  note: "person created by <email>",
});

const history = await client.events("person", "p-110");
console.log("Event count:", history.length);

await client.disconnect();
```

Swap in the Python, Java, PHP, .NET, or Go SDKs described on the Client SDKs page if you prefer another language.

## Next steps

- **Snapshots and verification**: `dbx aggregate snapshot rebuild` refreshes state, and `dbx aggregate verify` recomputes Merkle roots when you need to prove integrity.
- **Replication**: run `dbx watch standby` to stream changes to a standby node, or `dbx push/pull` for scheduled syncs.
- **Plugins**: configure HTTP or TCP plugins to fan events out to downstream services once your domain is populated.

<Note>Every CLI command accepts `--config <path>` if you need to target a custom configuration file or environment.</Note>
