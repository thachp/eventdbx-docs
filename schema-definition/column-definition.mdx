Columns describe the shape of each event payload. EventDBX treats them as contracts: once defined, they guide validation, documentation, and downstream tooling.

## Supported types

- `string`, `text`, `enum`
- `integer`, `decimal`, `float`
- `boolean`, `timestamp`
- `json`, `bytes`

Install custom types (UUIDv7, currency) via validators if needed.

## Adding columns

```bash
dbx schema column add invoice_issued amount --type decimal --required --description "Total invoice amount in minor units"
dbx schema column add invoice_issued currency --type enum --values USD EUR GBP --default USD
```

Columns apply to future events only. Historical payloads remain untouched but will fail validation if replayed without the required fields.

## Documenting ownership

Use annotations so teammates know who maintains each column:

```bash
dbx schema column annotate invoice_issued amount --owner billing-team --since 2024-04-01
```

These annotations surface inside generated docs and CLI descriptions.

## Deprecating fields

When a column is no longer needed:

```bash
dbx schema column deprecate invoice_issued legacy_id --sunset 2024-09-01 --note "Replaced by invoice_number"
```

Deprecation warns producers while keeping historical events valid. After the sunset date, remove the column entirely if no payloads reference it.

## Referencing columns in downstream systems

Because schemas live in version control (`docs.json` + MDX), you can generate OpenAPI or GraphQL types automatically. Run `dbx schema export --format openapi` to share definitions with other teams.
