Explain how rules attach to schemas, how to test them, and how to roll out changes.

## Topics to cover

- Explain global versus per-column rules plus ordering guarantees.
- Include examples for regex, numeric ranges, and custom validators.
- Note how rule changes propagate to historical data and what to do when they fail.
