title: "Switch Between Domains"
description: "Hop across bounded contexts without losing track of state, credentials, or replication offsets."

Switching domains is a daily task for anyone running multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) or business units (payments, risk, fulfillment). EventDBX keeps every domain isolated on disk so context switches are quick yet safe.

## Checkout workflow

```bash
dbx domain list
#> payments-prod  /srv/dbx/payments-prod
#> payments-dev   /srv/dbx/payments-dev

dbx checkout payments-dev
dbx status
```

`dbx checkout` updates the active RocksDB path, snapshots directory, config overrides, and default plugin namespace. Follow it with `dbx status` to confirm where commands will apply before you mutate data.

## Naming and structure tips

- Prefix domains with the product or bounded context, suffix with the environment (`orders-prod`, `orders-staging`).
- Store data directories under `/var/lib/dbx/<domain>` or attach separate volumes per domain if you need independent backup schedules.
- Commit a `.dbx-domain` file at the root of each repo to remind developers which domain their scripts expect.

## Replication awareness

Replication jobs are domain-aware. A standby that tracks `payments-prod` retains its own queue offsets. When you switch to `payments-dev`, replication commands only touch that domain:

```bash
dbx checkout payments-dev
dbx push dev-standby
```

This isolation prevents accidental promotion of the wrong dataset during incidents.

## Multi-tenant operators

If you host EventDBX for multiple customers, run one domain per tenant. Combine `dbx checkout` with shell prompts (`PS1`) or terminal titles that show the active domain so humans never confuse tenants. Automation should always pass `--domain` explicitly.

The end result: you can switch contexts in seconds without worrying that your commands will leak into another environment or corrupt an unrelated business line.
